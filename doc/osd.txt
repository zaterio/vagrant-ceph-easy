# To get the statistics for all placement groups stuck in a specified state, execute the following:
# ceph pg dump_stuck inactive|unclean|stale|undersized|degraded [--format <format>] [-t|--threshold <seconds>]
# Inactive Placement groups cannot process reads or writes because they are waiting for an OSD with the most up-to-date data to come up and in.
# Unclean Placement groups contain objects that are not replicated the desired number of times. They should be recovering.
# Stale Placement groups are in an unknown state - the OSDs that host them have not reported to the monitor cluster in a while (configured by mon_osd_report_timeout).
# Valid formats are plain (default) and json. 
# The threshold defines the minimum number of seconds the placement group is stuck before including it in the returned statistics (default 300 seconds).
